## Introduction to Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your Khaoula Ben Halima Documentation projects. This enables you to build integrations that react to changes automatically.

## Event Types

Subscribe to specific events to receive notifications only for the activities that matter to your integration.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Document Events" icon="file-text">
    Events related to document creation, updates, and deletion.
    
    | Event | Description | Payload |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | `document.created` | New document added | Document ID, title, author |
    | `document.updated` | Document content changed | Document ID, changes summary |
    | `document.deleted` | Document removed | Document ID, deletion reason |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Events" icon="folder">
    Events for project-level changes and team activities.
    
    | Event | Description | Payload |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | `project.created` | New project started | Project ID, name, owner |
    | `user.invited` | Team member invited | User email, role, inviter |
    | `user.joined` | User accepted invitation | User ID, name, role |
  </Tab>

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Endpoint" icon="server">
    Set up an HTTPS endpoint in your application to receive webhook payloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook" icon="settings">
    In your Khaoula Ben Halima Documentation dashboard, go to Settings > Webhooks and add your endpoint URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events" icon="check-square">
    Choose which events you want to receive notifications for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Webhook" icon="zap">
    Use our test feature to send a sample payload to your endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy" icon="rocket">
    Deploy your webhook handler and monitor for incoming events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup tabs="Node.js,Python">
  ```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const event = req.headers['x-webhook-event'];
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  
  // Verify signature
  if (verifySignature(req.body, signature)) {
    console.log(`Received event: ${event}`, req.body);
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } else {
    res.sendStatus(401);
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
  ```
  ```python
from flask import Flask, request
import hmac
import hashlib

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    event = request.headers.get('x-webhook-event')
    signature = request.headers.get('x-webhook-signature')
    
    # Verify signature
    if verify_signature(request.get_data(), signature):
        print(f"Received event: {event}", request.json)
        return '', 200
    else:
        return '', 401

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Verify Signatures">
    Always verify webhook signatures to ensure the payload hasn't been tampered with. Use HMAC-SHA256 with your webhook secret.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Use HTTPS">
    Only accept webhooks over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Validate Payloads">
    Check that incoming payloads contain expected data and handle them safely to prevent injection attacks.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="alert">Never expose your webhook secret in client-side code or public repositories.</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<Expandable title="Common Issues" default-open="false">
  - **Timeout Errors**: Ensure your endpoint responds within 10 seconds
  - **Signature Verification Fails**: Double-check your webhook secret and HMAC implementation
  - **Missing Events**: Verify that the events are enabled in your webhook configuration
  - **Duplicate Events**: Handle idempotency by checking event IDs
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="tip">Use our webhook logs in the dashboard to debug delivery issues and view recent payloads.</Callout>

## Rate Limiting

Webhook deliveries are subject to rate limits to prevent abuse. If your endpoint is unavailable, we'll retry delivery with exponential backoff.

| Scenario | Rate Limit | Retry Policy |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Normal delivery | 1000/hour | 3 attempts, exponential backoff |
| High volume events | 5000/hour | 5 attempts, exponential backoff |
| Endpoint errors | 100/hour | Stop after 10 failed attempts |
